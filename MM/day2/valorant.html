            During war of 1965 , a commando unit, named Meghdoot Force was
            formed comprising of officers and soldiers from infantry units under
            Maj Megh Singh of the Brigade of the Guards . The unit was highly
            successful in cross border operations during the war which forced
            the Indian Army and the government to create specialized forces to
            conduct operations which are bit complex for normal forces .
            Meghdoot Force was then transformed into parachute force because
            paratrooping is one of the most important commando tactics. Thus in
            July, 1966 under the 9th Battalion of the Parachute Regiment ,
            creation of 9 Para SF took place which was the first special ops
            unit of the Indian Armed Forces. On 1 July, 1967, 10 Para SF was
            raised as a sister unit of 9 Para SF . Since then other regiments
            creation also took place and Para SF regiments proved their mettle
            in 1971 War, Operation Blue Star, Operation Cactus, Operation Pawan
            , Kargil War and many more including recent surgical strikes where
            terror camps in PoK were demolished. More Details check: How To
